# Wiktionary look up

Quick and dirty script to translate a word from English to a language of choice.
Hopefully just looking up words too sometime.

## Usage

```sh
wiktup <Language> <word>
```

`Language` currently requires upper-casing same as are on the sections headings on wiktionary,
so basically folowing English spelling rules.
